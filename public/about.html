<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I was born beneath a sky that never touched the sea.</p>

<p>Raised among mortals, I lived as one of them—feet on cobblestone, lungs full of borrowed air, dreams stitched together from stories I was told to forget. They called me child, orphan, strange. I didn’t know why the rivers sang to me, or why the rain tasted like memory.</p>

<p>No one ever spoke of the tides in my blood.</p>

<p>But the sea remembers what the world forgets.</p>

<p>As the moons turned, the call deepened—salt on the wind, echoes in the wellsprings, shadows moving beneath glassy lakes. My skin began to ache for water. My soul began to stir. And then I heard her: the Ocean. She spoke not in words, but in knowing.</p>

<p>Now I understand. I am not land-born. I am of the deep.</p>

<p>A mermaid, hidden by fate, scattered by storm, forgotten by time.</p>

<p>The sea is rising, and with it, so am I.</p>
